  <P><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The man, the man's wife, and one other guy 
    survived a ship wreck. The<br>
    three people were marooned on a desert island for a long time. They<br>
    survived on the bits of food they could find. One day the other guy says<br>
    he will make dinner for everybody. The man comes to dinner, but he could<br>
    not find his wife. The man enjoyed the dinner so much he asked the other<br>
    guy what it was. The other guy said it was Albatross. Eventually the<br>
    two men are rescued and the man was very sad that he never found his wife.<br>
    <br>
    When the man gets back to civilization, he goes into a restaurant and<br>
    orders Albatross. When he tastes the food the waiter brings he realizes<br>
    that he has never eaten Albatross in his life. At that moment he knows<br>
    that he ate his wife on the desert island. Then he jumps out the window<br>
    and kills himself.</font></P>

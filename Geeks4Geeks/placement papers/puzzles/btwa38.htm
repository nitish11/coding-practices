When he first saw the		bird, he <BR>		was standing 250 yards due south of it. Both began running at		the same <BR>		time and ran with uniform speeds. The chicken ran due east. Instead		of <BR>		running northeast on a straight line, John ran so that at every		<BR>		instant he was running directly towards the chicken.<BR>		Assuming that John ran 1 1/3 times faster than the chicken, how		far <BR>		did the chicken run before it was caught???<BR>		<BR>		</FONT></P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">scroll down for answer!</FONT></P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG SRC="strobe.gif"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="6" COLOR="#FF0000">The Answer!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> <IMG SRC="strobe.gif"></FONT></P>			<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">First, determine how far John would travel to catch the chicken			if the <BR>			chicken and John both ran foward on a straight line. Add to this			the <BR>			distance that John would travel to catch the chicken if they ran			<BR>			towards eash other on a straight line. Divide the result by 2			and you <BR>			have the distance that John travels. In this case, the chicken			is 250 <BR>			yards away, and the speeds of John and the chicken are in proportion			<BR>			of 4 to 3. So, if both ran forward on a straight line, John would			<BR>			travel 1,000 yards to overtake the chicken. If they traveled towards			<BR>			each other, John would travel four-sevenths of 250, or 142 6/7			yards. <BR>			Adding the two distances and dividing by 2 gives us 571 3/7 yards			for <BR>			the distance traveled by John. Since the chicken runs at three-fourts			<BR>			the speed of John, it will have traveled three-fourths of John's			<BR>			distance, or 428 4/7 yards.</FONT></P>		</CENTER>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Click below for next teaser:</FONT></P>		<P><A HREF="BTWA39.html"><IMG SRC="Image-1328262249.gif"></A></P>	</BODY></HTML>

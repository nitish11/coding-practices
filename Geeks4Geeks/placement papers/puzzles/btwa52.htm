However, her husband followed		<BR>		her there. To escape him, she took a rowing boat and rowed to		the <BR>		center of the lake, marked by a buoy. Her husband was furious,		but, <BR>		knowing she would have to come to ashore eventually, decided to		wait <BR>		for her on the edge of the lake. He assumed that, because he could		<BR>		run 4 times as fast as Caroline could row, it would be simple		matter <BR>		for him to catch her when the boat touched the edge of the lake.		<BR>		   Caroline thought about her predicament. She knew that once		she was <BR>		on dry land she could run faster than her husband, so she devised		a <BR>		plan that got her to some point on the shore before he could get		<BR>		there. What was her strategy? You can assume that at all times		she <BR>		knew her exact position on the lake.</FONT></P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">scroll down for answer!</FONT></P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<CENTER>			<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><IMG SRC="strobe.gif"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="6" COLOR="#FF0000">The Answer!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> <IMG SRC="strobe.gif"></FONT></P>			<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">If Caroline's objective had been to escape by reaching the shore			as <BR>			quickly as possible, her best strategy would have been to row			so that <BR>			the center of the lake, marked by the buoy, was always between			her <BR>			and her husband. At the same time, maintaining the three points			in a <BR>			straight line, she should have rowed towards the shore. Assuming			that <BR>			her husband followed the strategy of always running in the same			<BR>			direction around the lake, at a speed four times as fast as she			can <BR>			row, Caroline's optimum path was a semicircle with a radius of			r/8, <BR>			where r is the lakes radius. At the end of this semicircle, she			would <BR>			have reached a distance of r/4 from the center of the lake. That			is <BR>			the point at which the angular velocity she would have had to			<BR>			maintain to keep her husband opposite her just equals his angular			<BR>			velocity, leaving her no reserve energy for moving outward. (If			<BR>			during this period her husband changed direction, she could have			done <BR>			as well or better by mirror-reflection her path.)<BR>			  As soon as Caroline reached the end of the semicircle, she headed			<BR>			straight for the nearest spot on the shore. She had a distance			of r/4 <BR>			to go. Her husband would have had to travel a distance of (pie)			times <BR>			r to catch her when she landed. She would have escaped, because			when <BR>			she reached the shore he would have gone a distance of only 3r.<BR>			  Suppose, however, Caroline preferred to reach the shore not			as soon <BR>			as possable but at a spot as far away as possable from her husband.			<BR>			In this case her best strategy, after she reached a point r/4			from <BR>			the center of the lake, would have been to row in a straight line			<BR>			that is tangent to the circle of radius r/4, moving is a direction			<BR>			opposite to the wat her husband was running.<BR>			</FONT></P>		</CENTER>		<P>&nbsp;</P>		<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFFFF">Click below for next teaser:</FONT></P>		<P><A HREF="BTWA53.html"><IMG SRC="Image-1328262249.gif"></A></P>	</BODY></HTML>

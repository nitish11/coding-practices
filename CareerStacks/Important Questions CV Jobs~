2) There are 6 bottles of drinks out of which one is poisoned. If a man tastes a drop of
that, he will die within 10 hours (Note : This part is different from that of the first question.
In previous question it was "exactly at the 10th hour" but here it is "within 10 hours"). A
doctor decides to check it out by using some number of mice within 16 hours. Then the
minimum number of mice needed to find out the poisoned bottle is:
a)2
b)4
c)6
d)3
Answer : d)3
Solution :
If mouse would die exactly at 10 hours then definitely 1 will be the answer but here the
given condition says that mouse will die within 10 hours.
so this question can be solved by set theory.
There is a Formula to use for these types of problems :
Consider there are b bottles to be tested. Then the minimum value of m such that 2m > =
b gives the minimum number of mice required.
In our case b = 6.
The minimum value of m for 2m > 6 is 3. (21=2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8. Only when m = 3, 2m
exceeds 6.)




5) On dividing (18377)10 by 11 the remainder will be
a)1
b)10
c)9
d)2
Answer : a)1
Solution :
To Remember :
Fermat's Little Theorem states : "If a is an integer and not divisible by p then a(p-1) - 1
is an integer multiple of p".
i.e., we get the remainder 1 when we divide a(p-1) by p. 
For example, consider a = 7 and p = 3. Here a is not divisible by p. a(p-1) - 1 = 7(3 - 1) - 1 =
7(2) - 1 = 49 - 1 = 48 is a multiple of 3
Here we have to divide (18377)10 by a prime 11.
Now, take a = 18377 and p = 11 Then , a(p-1) = (18377)10
Now, according to Fermat's Little Theorem, a(p-1) - 1 i.e (18377)10 - 1 should be an integer
which is a multiple of 11
(18377)10 - 1 when divided by 11 gives no remainder
This implies (18377)10 when divided by 11 gives 1 as remainder
Hence the answer is 1.





) 4 equal aged boys and 6 equal aged girls were regularly attending a guitar class. 22
is the average age of all and 56 is the age of two boys and three girls. After 3 years a
boy is replaced by a new boy aged 15. Now, what will be the average age of boys?
Options
a) 13.5 years
b) 15.4years
c) 16.3 years
d) 14 years
Answer : a) 13.5 years.
Solution:
Let X and Y be the age of a boy and a girl respectively.
Given that 22 is the average age of all.
Then 4X/4 + 6Y/6 = 22
i.e., X + Y = 22 ...eqn1
Also given that, 56 is the age of two boys and three girls.
Then, 2X + 3Y = 56 ...eqn2
Solving the above equations, we get X=10, Y=12.
That is, the age of each boy is 10 and age of each girl is 12.
After 3 years, 1 among 4 boys leaves the group but replaced by a new 15 year old boy.
Sum of the ages of 3 left over boys + new boy = Ages of original 3 boys after 3 years +
Age of new boy = 3(X+3) + 15 = 3x13 + 15 = 54 years.
Their average age = Total Age / 4 = 54/4 = 13.5 years.





2) The product of the distinct roots of the equation (3x)(3x+2)(3x-4)(3x-6)= 64 is:
a)-32/27
b)-61/5
c)63/16
d)69/12
Answer : a)-32/27
Solution:
Given that, (3x)(3x+2)(3x-4)(3x-6)= 64
Let 3x - 2 = p
Then the given eqn becomes
(p + 2) (p + 4) (p - 2) (p - 4) = 64
(p2 - 4) (p2 - 16) = 64




3) A merchant had a diamond, cost of which varies as a square of its weight. The
merchant broke the diamond into 3 pieces in the ratio (based on weights) 4:5:6. When
the pieces were sold he incurred a loss of Rs.444000. What could be the original price of
the diamond.
a)Rs.750000
b)Rs.665000
c)Rs.600000
d)Rs.675000
Answer : d) Rs.675000.
Solution:
As given, the weights of the broken pieces are in the ratio 4:5:6.
Let the actual weights of broken pieces be 4X,5X and 6X.
Then weight of the original diamond = 4X + 5X + 6X = 15X
Since the cost of a diamond varies as its square of the weight, the original cost will be
(15X)2 = 225(X2). ...(1)
The total cost of individual pieces will be (4X)2 + (5X)2 + (6X)2 = (16 + 25 + 36)x(X2) =
77(X2). ...(2)
The loss value = (1) - (2) = 225(X2)-77(X2) = 148(X2).
But the above loss value is given to be Rs.444000
Therefore, 148(X2)=Rs.444000
X2 =Rs.444000/148.
=Rs.3000
Original cost = 225(X2) = 225 x 3000
= 675000
Hence the answer is Rs.675000.








1) Is the integer k is divisible by 40?
1) 8 is a factor of k
2) k is a factor of 10
Options :
(a) statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the
question
(b) statement 2 alone is sufficient, but statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the
question
(c) both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question, but neither
statement alone is sufficient
(d) each statement alone is sufficient
(e) statements 1 and 2 together are not sufficient, and additional data is needed to
answer the question.
Answer : (b) statement 2 alone is sufficient, but statement 1 alone is not sufficient to
answer the question.
Solution :
From statement 1,
suppose 8 is a factor of k then k can be 8, 16, 24 and so on.
Only some multiples of 8 are only divisible by 40
Therefore the statement 1 alone is not sufficient to derive the answer.
From statement 2,
The factors of 10 are 1,2,5 and 10.
If k is a factor of 10 then k belongs to {1,2,5,10}
No element in the above set is divisible by 40.
Hence k is certainly not divisible by 40. Hence using statement 2, we can give a
conclusive answer that k is not divisible by 40.
Thus statement2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.







2) From a bus stand, buses leave for every 15 minutes to both temple and Railway
junction. First bus towards junction is at 7.00 am and towards temple is at 7.10 a.m.
Suppose you have to visit both temple and junction and decide to go by the first bus you
encounter. Then the probability to get a bus towards temple is ___ .
a)0.67 b)0.5 c)0.75 d)0.33
Answer : a)0.67
Solution :
Let us discuss an interesting method to solve such problems :
Let's simulate a 60 minute time period:
A period of 60 Minutes broken into intervals of 5 minutes each:
0 - 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 - 35 - 40 - 45 - 50 - 55 - 60(or "0" again)
Arrival of BUS : ( t = temple, j = junction, X = no bus arrives at that particular time)
j-X-t-j-X-t-j-X-t-j-X-t-j
TO MAKE IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE WRITTEN THE SAME THING
AGAIN.
0 - 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 - 35 - 40 - 45 - 50 - 55 - 60
j -X -t - j- X- t - j-x - t - j -x - t -j
0
10
5
10 5
10 5
10 5
The line written immediately above (that is the 3rd line of data) has numbers
corresponding to "t" and "j" which shows how many minutes a person has to wait till he
gets the "First bus".
Therefore,
t= 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 Minutes
j= 0 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 Minutes
Therefore in 40 minutes of standing time for the bus you will get t bus and in 20 minutes
of standing time for the bus you will get j bus.
You will also see that this is the schedule for every hour after 7.00 A.M.
This means that the probability to get t bus is = 40 Minutes / 60 Minutes = 2/3 = 0.67
Also the probability to get j bus is = 20 Minutes / 60 Minutes = 1/3 = 0.33
Hence the answer is 0.67






3) In a family there are several brothers and sisters. Every 2 boys have brothers as
many as sisters and each girl has 2 brothers less than twice as many brothers as sisters.
Now find the number of boys and girls.
a)6,8 b)8,6 c)12,10
d)6,4
Answer : b)8,6
Solution:
Let b be the number of brothers and s be the number of sisters in the family.
Consider any two boys. They would be having b - 2 brothers (excluding the two). But this
number is equal to the number of sisters they have.
Therefore,
b-2=s
or b - s = 2 ----- (1)
Each girl will have s - 1 sisters. Twice the number of sisters = 2(s - 1).
Since each girl has twice as many brothers as sisters, we have, 2(s-1)-2 = b
2s - 4 = b ---- (2).
Sub b = 2s - 4 in eq 1, we get
2s - 4 - s = 2
s=6
Sub s in eq 1 we get,
b-6=2
b=8









5) The Calendar for the year 2013 is the same as for the year?
a) 2020
b) 2018
c) 2017
d) 2019
Answer : d) 2019
Solution:
For calendar to repeat exactly, the dates and days have to match perfectly.
Consider 2014 :
Any date on 2014 will correspond to same date on 2013 advanced by one day. (same
logic used in first question.) For example if Jan 1 is Tuesday on 2013, then Jan 1 will be
Wednesday on 2014.
Year 2014 2015 2016 (leap year)
Advanced days 1 1 2
2017 2018
1
2019
1
1
In 2019 the total number of advancements will be 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 . Any week
has seven days. Hence advancement of 7 days also means the days are going to be the
same for any dates. That is if 1st Jan on 2013 is Tuesday, then 1st Jan on 2019 will also
be Tuesday.
Hence the calendar for the year 2013 and 2019 is the same.




11) Today is 4.11.09. Keeping that figure 41109 in mind, i have arrived at the

90 + 4 = 5
So next is 49 + 1 = 262144






7) A train starts from A towards B with some velocity. Due to an engine problem, after
travelling 3/8 of its journey, it slows to 3/5 of its actual velocity. The train reaches B 1
hour later than the actual planned time. If the engine had failed after travelling 80km and
if it would have slowed down to 4/5th of its initial velocity for another 80km and covered
the remaining distance with 1/2 of its initial velocity, the train would have reached the
destination one and half hours late. What is the distance between A and B in meters?
a)10000
b)480000
c)240000
d)520000
Answer : b)480000
Solution:
Let the distance between A and B be X and the speed initially be V.
The train travels 3X/8km with speed V and the remaining distance(X - 3X/8)km with
speed 3/5 of V. Ultimately the train was late by 1 hour.
According to the above condition with the formula " distance/speed = time", we can have
[(3X/8)/V]+[(X-(3X/8))/(3V/5)] = [X/V]+1
[3X/8V] + 5(8X-3X)/24V = [X/V]+1
9X+25X-24X / 24V = 1
10X-24V = 0 ..........eqn1
According to the question, if the train travelled 80km with speed V, another 80km with
4/5 th of V and the remaining distance(X-160)km with speed 1/2 of V then
[80/V]+[80/(4V/5)]+[(X-160)/(1V/2)] = [X/V]+3/2




12) There is a unique number of which the square and the cube together use all
ciphers from 0 up to 9 exactly once. Which number is this?
Answer: The number is 69.

13) In a certain code RELATED to written as EFUBKDQ. How is RETAINS written in that
code?
a) SDQBTOJ b) JOTBQDS
C) JOTBSDQ d) TOJBSDQ
Answer : d) TOJBSDQ
Reason :
Inspecting how RELATED was written as EFUBKDQ, we can easily find that,
RELATED – is first written as DETALER
DETALER becomes EFUBKDQ (+1,+1,+1, +1,-1,-1,-1 – alphabetically)
Applying the same logic to RETAINS we get,
RETAINS is first written as SNIATER
SNIATER becomes TOJBSDQ (applying the above rule)
